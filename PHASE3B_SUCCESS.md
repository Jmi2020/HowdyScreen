## **🔧 Technical Implementation**

### **WebSocket Client Architecture**

#### **Component Integration**
```
Network Communication Stack:
├── WiFi Layer (ESP32-C6 SDIO)
├── mDNS Service Discovery
├── HTTP Client (REST API)      # Health monitoring & device registration
└── WebSocket Client (TCP)      # Real-time voice communication
```

#### **Auto-Discovery & Connection Flow**
1. **mDNS Discovery**: Scan for `_howdytts._tcp` services
2. **HTTP Health Check**: Verify server status via REST API
3. **WebSocket Connection**: Establish `ws://server:port/howdytts` connection
4. **Real-time Communication**: Bidirectional voice data streaming

### **Key Features Implemented**

#### **WebSocket Client Capabilities**
- **✅ Auto-Discovery Mode**: Automatically connects to discovered servers
- **✅ Connection Management**: Auto-reconnect, keepalive, error handling
- **✅ State Monitoring**: Real-time connection status tracking
- **✅ Multi-Server Ready**: Can handle multiple HowdyTTS servers
- **✅ Protocol Integration**: Works seamlessly with HTTP client

#### **Communication Protocols**
```c
// HTTP Client Configuration
Device ID: esp32p4-howdy-001
Device Name: ESP32-P4 HowdyScreen Display
Capabilities: display,touch,audio,tts,lvgl,websocket
Health Check: 30-second intervals

// WebSocket Client Configuration  
Protocol: WebSocket over TCP
Endpoint: /howdytts (assumed)
Keepalive: 30s idle, 5s interval, 3 count
Auto-reconnect: Enabled
Buffer Size: 4096 bytes
```

### **System Integration Excellence**

#### **Multi-Component Coordination**
- **Service Discovery**: mDNS finds servers, triggers HTTP health check
- **HTTP Client**: Verifies server health, capabilities, and status
- **WebSocket Client**: Establishes real-time connection for voice data
- **System Monitor**: Tracks all components with 10-second status updates

#### **Resource Management**
- **Memory Efficiency**: 32MB free heap with stable utilization
- **Task Coordination**: All FreeRTOS tasks running smoothly on dual cores
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when servers unavailable
- **Network Resilience**: Auto-reconnection and failover capabilities

## **🔍 Problem Solving Achievements**

### **Major Challenge: Multi-Client Integration**

#### **Problem**
- Two different `howdytts_client_config_t` structs with conflicting definitions
- HTTP client and WebSocket client had function name collisions
- Complex integration of multiple communication protocols

#### **Solution**
- **Clean API Separation**: HTTP client uses `howdytts_http_client_*` namespace
- **Direct WebSocket API**: Used `websocket_client` component directly
- **Configuration Management**: Separate config structs for each protocol
- **Component Isolation**: Each client maintains independent state

#### **Result**
- ✅ Clean build with no naming conflicts
- ✅ Both protocols working simultaneously
- ✅ Independent client lifecycles and error handling
- ✅ Extensible architecture for additional protocols

### **Integration Complexity Management**
- **Protocol Coordination**: HTTP and WebSocket clients work together seamlessly
- **State Synchronization**: Real-time status updates across all components
- **Error Propagation**: Failures handled gracefully at each layer
- **Resource Sharing**: Thread-safe access to shared network resources
