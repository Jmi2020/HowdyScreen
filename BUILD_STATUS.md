# ESP32P4 Build Status

## Current Issues

The ESP32P4 firmware has several compilation errors that need to be resolved:

### 1. WiFi Configuration Missing
- `CONFIG_ESP_WIFI_STATIC_RX_BUFFER_NUM` undefined
- `CONFIG_ESP_WIFI_DYNAMIC_RX_BUFFER_NUM` undefined
- These are required for `WIFI_INIT_CONFIG_DEFAULT()` macro

### 2. System Function Missing
- `esp_clk_cpu_freq()` function not available in ESP32P4

### 3. Build Approach Options

#### Option A: Fix Configuration Issues
1. Run `idf.py menuconfig` to configure WiFi options
2. Add missing system includes
3. Complete full build

#### Option B: Simplified Build (Recommended for Testing)
1. Temporarily disable WiFi provisioning
2. Use hardcoded WiFi credentials
3. Test core audio/display functionality first
4. Add advanced features after basic functionality works

## Files Status
✅ **Working:**
- Audio pipeline (ES8311 codec)
- Display manager (LVGL + GIF support)
- LED controller
- Server discovery (mDNS)
- Howdy GIF animation

❌ **Compilation Errors:**
- WiFi provisioning system
- Network manager (WiFi config issues)
- Main task (system function missing)

## Recommendation

Let's create a minimal working build first, then add the advanced WiFi provisioning later. This will allow you to:

1. Flash and test the ESP32P4 immediately
2. Verify audio input/output works
3. Test Howdy animation display
4. Confirm server connectivity
5. Add WiFi provisioning in next iteration

Would you like me to create the simplified build?
