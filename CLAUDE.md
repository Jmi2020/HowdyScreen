# ESP32-P4 HowdyScreen Project Configuration

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT DEVELOPMENT GUIDELINES

### **Dual-Project Workflow (REQUIRED)**
**ALWAYS work in both projects when implementing solutions:**
- **ESP32-P4 HowdyScreen Project**: `/Users/silverlinings/Desktop/Coding/ESP32P4/HowdyScreen/`
- **HowdyTTS Server Project**: `/Users/silverlinings/Desktop/Coding/RBP/HowdyTTS/`

**Implementation Pattern:**
1. **Identify the full solution scope** - Consider both ESP32-P4 and HowdyTTS requirements
2. **Make corresponding changes in both projects** - Ensure protocol compatibility
3. **Update documentation in both locations** - Keep both projects synchronized
4. **Test integration between both sides** - Verify end-to-end functionality

**Examples of Dual-Project Changes:**
- **Network protocols**: Update WebSocket ports in both ESP32-P4 client AND HowdyTTS server
- **Audio formats**: Ensure PCM format compatibility between sender and receiver
- **Discovery mechanisms**: Implement discovery broadcasting on ESP32-P4 AND listening on HowdyTTS
- **Error handling**: Coordinate timeout values and retry logic on both sides

**DO NOT FLASH HARDWARE**: User handles all `idf.py flash` operations. AI should only:
- Build firmware (`idf.py build`)  
- Analyze code and logs
- Make code changes
- Never attempt `idf.py flash` or `idf.py monitor` commands

## üåê NETWORK PORTABILITY FEATURES

**Network-Agnostic Discovery System** - The ESP32-P4 and HowdyTTS server automatically find each other on any WiFi network without hardcoded IP addresses:

### ESP32-P4 Discovery Process:
- Broadcasts `"HOWDYTTS_DISCOVERY"` to multiple addresses:
  - Global broadcast: `255.255.255.255:8001`
  - Subnet broadcast: `192.168.x.255:8001` (calculated dynamically)
  - Retries every 2 seconds with 30-second periodic rescans
- Works across different network configurations (home, office, hotel WiFi)

### HowdyTTS Server Discovery:
- Listens on `0.0.0.0:8001` for discovery requests from any ESP32-P4 device
- Responds with `"HOWDYTTS_SERVER_{hostname}"` to identify itself
- Optional mDNS advertising as `_howdytts._udp.local.` for enhanced discovery
- Automatically registers devices by their source IP address

### Seamless Network Migration:
- **No IP Configuration Required**: Both devices discover each other automatically
- **Works Anywhere**: Home WiFi, office networks, mobile hotspots, hotel WiFi
- **Fault Tolerant**: Handles router broadcast restrictions, network topology changes
- **Zero Setup**: Just ensure both devices are on the same WiFi network

**Usage**: Simply connect both ESP32-P4 and HowdyTTS server to the same WiFi network - they will find each other automatically within seconds.
